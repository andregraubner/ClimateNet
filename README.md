# CS230 Semantic Segmentation of Extreme Climate Events


Tropical cyclones (TCs), also known as hurricanes, typhoons or tropical storms, are the most destructive type of extreme weather events and have caused $1.1 trillion in damage and 6,697 deaths since 1980 in the US alone. 

In this project, we apply the light-weight CGNet context guided computer vision architecture to semantic segmentation for the identification of tropical cyclones in climate data.

## Data

ClimateNet is an open, community-sourced, human expert-labeled data set, mapping the outputs of Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5.1) climate simulation runs, for 459 time steps from 1996 to 2013. 

Each example is a netCDF file containing an array (1152, 768) for one time step, with each pixel mapping to a (latitude, longitude) point, with 16 channels for key atmospheric variables and one class label.

The data set is split in a \textbf{training set} of 398 (map, labels) pairs spanning years 1996 to 2010 in the CAM5.1 climate simulation, and a \textbf{test set} of 61 (map, labels) pairs spanning 2011 to 2013.

## ClimateNet library

ClimateNet is a Python library for deep learning-based Climate Science. It provides tools for quick detection and tracking of extreme weather events, and is used as the implementation of our baseline model.

## Baseline

We use the library and the published implementation of the CGNet network as our baseline, and assess baseline performance on the latest published weights trained over the ClimateNet training set for 15 epochs with the Jaccard loss (weights available at [https://portal.nersc.gov/project/ClimateNet/climatenet_new/model/](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/ClimateNet/climatenet_new/model/).)
